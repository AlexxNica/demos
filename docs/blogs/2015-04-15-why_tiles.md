## Routing Tiles - Why?

We had just started our new endeavor at Mapzen and were kicking around fundamental ideas of what our system should look like. Here's a bit of a transcript of how we got here:

    01:27 EST Kevin: *wakes up in a cold sweat and begins to fumble around for his phone*

    01:28 EST Kevin: *violently stubs his toe on the sharpest lego he's ever whitnessed*

    01:30 EST Kevin: *cursing and slightly bloody, he manages to ring Dave*

    01:32 EST Dave: Uhnnng...

    01:32 EST Kevin: Dave! What if we route on tiled data!?

    01:33 EST Dave: Um... yeah... you've been working in the mapping world for far too long

    01:33 EST Dave: *throws his phone to the furthest corner of the room*

    01:34 EST Kevin: Dave??

    01:35 EST Kevin: *begins pacing*

    04:17 EST Kevin: *still pacing*

    07:01 EST Kevin: *rings dave once again*

    07:02 EST Kevin: But Dave... We can have levels of detail, regional extracts, offline mobile routing... and we can open source it all

    07:03 EST Dave: Hmm... Tiled. Hierarchical. Open. Routing. We could call it THOR. That's a pretty sweet acronym/project name. But yeah... I'm not sure it'll work.

That is not exactly the way it happened, but lets say Kevin's proposal was met with skepticism. But after reasoned consideration the team decided that tiled, hierarchical routing data had merits and was worth pursuing.

Now several months later we have seen that tiling of the routing graph is possible and we are starting to explore some of the benefits. 

Memory Footprint and Caching

Updates

Regional Extracts - Supporting off-line routing

Graph (the route data structure) tiles can be downloaded for use by client-side routing applications or by hosted services that donâ€™t want to go through the pain of data creation.

One caution with route tile is that, unlike map tiles, sometimes data is needed in adjecent tiles to form connections. This means that sometimes extra tiles will be needed - especially if one is concerned with routing to locations near the edges of the extracted tiles.

Tiles along a route - Client-side "Return to Route"

Tiles along a route can be downloaded to a client device prior to departing on a route (or an incremental update method can be used to update as the route is traversed). Having tiled route data near where the user deviates from the planned route will allow applications to perform on-device route computations to get the user back onto the planned route - removing the need to go back a server to recompute the route.
