## Routing Tiles - Why?

We had just started our new endeavor at Mapzen and were kicking around fundamental ideas of what our system should look like. Kevin called Dave and the conversation went like this:

Kevin: "Hey Dave. What if we create route tiles!"

Dave: "You've been working in the map world too long". click

Undaunted, Kevin called the next day:
Kevin: " But Dave. We can have levels of detail too. This would be so cool to put in open source."

Dave: "Hmm...Tiled. Hierarchical. Open. Routing. What a great acronym and project name, but not sure it will work."

That is not exactly the way it happened, but lets say Kevin's proposal was met with skepticism. But after reasoned consideration the team decided that tiled, hierarchical routing data had merits and was worth pursuing.

Now several months later we have seen that tiling of the routing graph is possible and we are starting to explore some of the benefits. 

Memory Footprint and Caching

Regional Extracts - Supporting off-line routing

Graph (the route data structure) tiles can be downloaded for use by client-side routing applications or by hosted services that donâ€™t want to go through the pain of data creation.

One caution with route tile is that, unlike map tiles, sometimes data is needed in adjecent tiles to form connections. This means that sometimes extra tiles will be needed - especially if one is concerned with routing to locations near the edges of the extracted tiles.

Tiles along a route - Client-side "Return to Route"

Tiles along a route can be downloaded to a client device prior to departing on a route (or an incremental update method can be used to update as the route is traversed). Having tiled route data near where the user deviates from the planned route will allow applications to perform on-device route computations to get the user back onto the planned route - removing the need to go back a server to recompute the route.
