# Routing

This is a routing demo that uses Valhalla or OSRM services endpoint (//{localhost|osrm.mapzen.com}/{car|foot|bicycle}/viaroute?) and finds direction between any given two points.
We are currently defaulted to Valhalla services.  To switch to OSRM, uncomment the OSRM url in L.Routing.OSRM.js.
